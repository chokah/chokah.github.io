        <h1>Chokah - Bio</h1>
        <p>Chokah belongs to a generation that witnessed legendary brands rise to greatness, only to see them fade. From Britney's high-profile moments to the decline of MTV and Viva, this was a time of both aspiration and disillusionment. "We were sold a dream," Chokah reflects. "But so much of what was glorified back then crumbled, revealing itself as either unsustainable or simply not what we thought it was. We are the CD generation."</p>

        <p>What people today call '90s nostalgia' was just life to us—a life filled with big dreams, empathy, and perhaps a little too much caution. We aimed high, but we also learned to see through the cracks of that glittering facade.</p>

        <p>And while technology has evolved, Chokah remains committed to one core principle: "Maybe AI will refine this text, but at the end of the day, only one thing really matters—I demand authenticity and truth in my lyrics."</p>

        <p>Oh, and one more thing—Chokah's lyrics? They're all in German.</p>
